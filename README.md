# Bus Topology Simulation in NS2

## AIM

To create and monitor a Bus Topology and effective data transmission using NS2 Software.

## APPARATUS REQUIRED

*   PC System with Linux OS
*   NS2 software

## ALGORITHM
 
* STEP 1: Start the program. 
* STEP 2: Declare the global variables ns for creating a new simulator. 
* STEP 3: Open the network animator file in the write mode. 
* STEP 4: Open the trace file in the write mode. 
* STEP 5: Transfer the packets in network. 
* STEP 6: Create the capable no of nodes. 
* STEP 7: Create the duplex-link between the nodes including the delay time, bandwidth 
and dropping queue mechanism. 
* STEP 8: Set a tcp connection for source node. 
* STEP 9: Set the destination node using tcp sink. 
* STEP 10: Set the window size and the packet size for the tcp. 
* STEP 11: Set up the ftp over the tcp connection. 
* STEP 12: Create the traffic generator CBR for the source and destination files. 
* STEP 13: Define the plot window and finish procedure. 
* STEP 14: In the definition of the finish procedure declare the global variables. 
* STEP 15: Close the trace file and namefile and execute the network animation 
file.
* STEP 16: At the particular time call the finish procedure. 
* STEP 17: Stop the program.

## CODE:
```#Create a simulator object 
set ns [new Simulator] 
#Open the nam trace file 
set nf [open out.nam w] 
$ns namtrace-all $nf 
#Define a 'finish' procedure 
proc finish {} 
{ 
global ns nf 
$ns flush-trace 
close $nf 
#Execute nam on the trace file 
exec nam out.nam & 
exit 0 
} 
#Create five nodes 
set n0 [$ns node] 
set n1 [$ns node] 
set n2 [$ns node] 
set n3 [$ns node] 
set n4 [$ns node] 
#Create Lan between the nodes 
set lan0 [$ns newLan "$n0 $n1 $n2 $n3 $n4" 0.5Mb 40ms LL Queue/DropTail MAC/Csma/Cd Channel] 
#Create a TCP agent and attach it to node n0 
set tcp0 [new Agent/TCP] 
$tcp0 set class_ 1 
$ns attach-agent $n1 $tcp0 
#Create a TCP Sink agent (a traffic sink) for TCP and attach it to node n3  
set  sink0 [new Agent/TCPSink] 
$ns attach-agent $n3 $sink0 
#Connect the traffic sources with the traffic sink 
$ns connect $tcp0 $sink0 
# Create a CBR traffic source and attach it to tcp0 
set  cbr0 [new Application/Traffic/CBR] 
$cbr0 set packetSize_ 500 
$cbr0 set interval_ 0.01 
$cbr0 attach-agent $tcp0 
#Schedule events for the CBR agents 
$ns at 0.5 "$cbr0 start" 
$ns at 4.5 "$cbr0 stop" 
#Call the finish procedure after 5 seconds of simulation time 
$ns at 5.0 "finish" 
$ns run
```
